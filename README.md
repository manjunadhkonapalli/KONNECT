# Mini-Social-Media

Hey everyone this is a web based application which has all the features that a modern social media app does have.

I have built this socialMedia with MERN- React, Nextjs, socket io for realTime chat & Notifications, Infinite Scroll etc...

This is the most complex MERN app that i have ever created
#



**Key points**

* **React** and **NextJS** for our Frontend and **Express** with **Node** on the backend. **MongoDb** as database.
* I have used **Socket.io** for **Realtime** connection between multiple clients for messaging.

* Created complex & interlinked **MongoDB Models** for storing all the **INFO of users**, **MESSAGES** they send and receive, their **NOTIFICATIONS**, **FOLLOWING** and **FOLLOWERS** of a user.I have stored everything in my database. (**MongoDB Atlas**)

* Also implemented to **show the online users** in this app to the logged user just like in any big social network.
* The green dots below in chats shows the online users

* **Real time chat** with **multiple users**. So no need to refresh the page to check if there is a new message. Everything is going to happen in real time. Also, we are going to **play a notification sound** when there is a new message.

* **REALTIME NOTIFICATIONS** whenever someone **LIKES** or **COMMENTS** on your posts. Also when someone **FOLLOWS** you.

* Only going to show the **posts of the users we are following.** So, exactly the same way it happens in big social networks like instagram, facebook

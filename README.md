# Mini-Social-Media

Hey everyone this is a web based application which has all the features that a modern social media app does have.

I have built this socialMedia with MERN- React, Nextjs, socket io for realTime chat & Notifications, Infinite Scroll etc...

This is the most complex MERN app that i have ever created

**Key points**
--> React and NextJ for our Frontend and Express with Node on the backend. i used Socket.io for Realtime connection between multiple clients for messaging.

--> Created complex & interlinked MongoDB Models for storing the info of users, messages they send and receive, their notifications, following and followers of a user.I have stored everything in my database. (MongoDB Atlas)

# Mini-Social-Media

Hey everyone this is a web based application which has all the features that a modern social media app does have.

I have built this socialMedia with MERN- React, Nextjs, socket io for realTime chat & Notifications, Infinite Scroll etc...

This is the most complex MERN app that i have ever created



**Key points**

--> React and NextJ for our Frontend and Express with Node on the backend. i used Socket.io for Realtime connection between multiple clients for messaging.

--> Created complex & interlinked MongoDB Models for storing the info of users, messages they send and receive, their notifications, following and followers of a user.I have stored everything in my database. (MongoDB Atlas)

--> Also implemented to show the online users in this app to the logged user just like in any big social network.

--> Real time chat with multiple users. So no need to refresh the page to check if there is a new message. Everything is going to happen in real time. Also, we are going to play a notification sound when there is a new message.

--> Only going to show the posts of the users we are following. So, exactly the same way it happens in big social networks like instagram, facebook
